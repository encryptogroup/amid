## AMI aiD (AMID) ##

As [public AMIs often contain security or privacy critical information](http://trust.cased.de/AMID), we developed the AMID tool to detect the most important vulnerabilities in publicly available VM images.

The AMID tool scans your system for security or privacy critical data before publishing or when started as virtual machine in the cloud, e.g., an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

Although the terminology we choose is based on that by the Amazon Web Services (AWS), AMID can be used also for other infrastructure-as-a-service (IAAS) cloud providers.

The script will not change any files and does not communicate over the Internet. Please run the script as "root" user for read access to all directories and files.

The script gives recommendations to protect
- the Publisher (P) of the AMI not to include private data when publishing the AMI and
- the Consumer (C) of the AMI to remove security vulnerabilities when running the AMI.

Note: This script finds only the most important security and privacy critical data in AMIs.
